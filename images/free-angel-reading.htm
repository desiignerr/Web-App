It is up to the Customer or User or Visitor to update his or her bank details in a timely manner and inform us of any payment problem.</strong>

	<br />
	<p>
		By paying with a bank card, the Customer or User or Visitor guarantees REPLAY SARL that he or she is duly authorized to use that mode of payment. He or she acknowledges that communicating the details of his or her bank card is deemed as giving his or her authorization to debit his or her bank account in favour of REPLAY SARL, the owner of the www.my-angel-reading.com site, for the total amount due, notwithstanding the absence of a written agreement
	</p>
	<p>
		It may be agreed with the billing service to stagger the payments over a period not exceeding three months at no extra charge for you. A recap of the payment instalment arrangements (date and amount) is given in the invoice or sent by e-mail
	</p>
	<p>
		If you opt for staggered payment, the written approval and your providing your bank card number will constitute the order to pay the full amount due as well as the authorization to pay the agreed amounts at the agreed dates notwithstanding the absence of a written agreement
	</p>
	<p>
		The email exchanges will serve as a basis for endorsing your acceptance and for the bill(s). <strong>Acceleration clause</strong>: In the event of failure to pay any instalment at the agreed date, in part or in full, the entire amount to be paid will fall due immediately and debited in one or more transactions from your bank card to the extent of the total amount that you approved initially
	</p>
	<p>
		You authorize REPLAY SARL to collect the residual amount due from your account in one or more debits, the objective being to agree upon an amicable solution for the settlement of the amounts due, thus avoiding litigation proceedings. The Customer or User or Visitor will be informed by email of the total residual amount due and the date on which the payment transaction will be carried out, until the total amount that he or she had approved initially when establishing the payment schedule has been settled.
	</p>

	<br />

	<h3>
		7 - Transaction security
	</h3>
	<p>
		The bank card payment system is equipped with SSL 3.0 (Secure Sockets Layer) that is used to code the Customer's or User's or Visitor's bank card number using 128-bit encryption
	</p>
	<p>
		You will enter your confidential bank card details in a secure area managed entirely by the processors of our certified PCI-DSS compliant Partners. REPLAY SARL cannot under any circumstances access this fully secure area
	</p>
	<p>
		If your bank card is refused, the payment solutions or certified PCI-DSS compliant Partners will process the payment again within the specified time frame, and repeat the same as many times as authorized by the governing rules
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to optimise the quality of our Customer Services and to serve you better, REPLAY SARL reserves the right to replace the existing payment solutions or certified PCI-DSS compliant Partners with others as needed without having to inform you beforehand.

	<br />

	<h3>
		24 – Special provision on arbitration for Customers or Users or Visitors from the United States and Canada
	</h3>
	<p>
		PLEASE READ THIS PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY AS IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT ARE ONLY APPLICABLE TO PERSONS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA WHO USE OUR WEBSITE. IF YOU USE WWW.MY-ANGEL-READING.COM IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN CANADA, YOU AND WE MUST SUBMIT ALL CLAIMS FOR INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT INVOLVING ANY DISPUTES RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THOSE THAT MAY BE BROUGHT BEFORE A SMALL CLAIMS COURT. THIS MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT THESE DISPUTES BE SETTLED IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THIS PARAGRAPH ALSO LIMITS THE PERIOD IN WHICH YOU MAY SUBMIT A CLAIM, INCLUDING THE PERIOD IN WHICH YOU MAY INITIATE AN ARBITRATION, OR WHERE AUTHORISED, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. FINALLY, YOU MAY SUBMIT A CLAIM ONLY IN YOUR OWN NAME, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF AN OFFICIAL OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR CATEGORY OF PERSONS. YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO TAKE PART IN ANY CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR TO ASK FOR YOUR DISPUTE TO BE HEARD AND SETTLED IN ONE OF THESE FORMS.
	</p>
	<p>
		The expression “Excluded Dispute” refers to any Dispute concerning the application or violation of our or your intellectual property rights (such as copyright or brand rights, domain names, logos, presentation, trade secrets and patents). For the sake of clarity, and notwithstanding the foregoing, any Disputes relating in any way to your privacy rights and image rights, or resulting from them, do not constitute Excluded Disputes.
		Federal Arbitration Act. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and application of this paragraph “Special provision on arbitration for users in the United States and Canada”, including any question determining whether a dispute between REPLAY SARL and you is subject to arbitration.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Arbitration approval for users in the United States or Canada. </strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		For persons residing in the United States or in Canada who use <strong>www.my-angel-reading.com,</strong> REPLAY SARL and you accept to waive the right to legal proceedings before a judge or jury for all Disputes except Excluded Disputes.
	</p>
	<p>
		REPLAY SARL and you agree that all Disputes (except Excluded Disputes), including those relating in any way to your privacy and image rights or resulting from them, will be settled via a definitive and binding arbitration. REPLAY SARL and you agree not to combine a Dispute subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not admissible for arbitration under our Terms.
	</p>
	<p>
		The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its rules on commercial arbitration at the time that the arbitration is initiated, including its optional rules on emergency protection measures and its additional procedures applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules, information about initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration procedure are available at the address www.adr.org.
	</p>
	<p>
		There will be three arbitrators. The language of arbitration will be French. The arbitration of any claim or disagreement referred to in this Agreement will take place in Switzerland or in the place where you received these General Terms or in your country or state of origin.
	</p>
	<p>
		REPLAY SARL will bear the cost of the arbitration fees and undertakes to complete the arbitration via the AAA offices in your country of origin for claims not exceeding €25,000. For claims of less than €10,000, REPLAY SARL also warrants that hearings will take place by telephone and that REPLAY SARL will not attempt to recover its legal fees if the procedure is in favour of the Company. You agree and accept that each Party will pay and bear the fees for its own legal council, experts and witnesses.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Refusal procedure.</strong> You may refuse this arbitration clause. In this case, none of the parties (you or us) may force the other to take part in an arbitration procedure. To indicate your refusal, you must inform us in writing no later than 30 days (as evidenced by the postmark) after whichever of the following dates falls latest: (i) the date on which you initially accepted our Terms; and (ii) the date on which you became subject to this arbitration provision. All summons for REPLAY SARL must be addressed to the following address: REPLAY SARL rue Adrien-Lachenal 20, 1207 Geneva, Switzerland - registration number CHE-424.688.593.
	</p>
	<p>
		You must indicate: (i) your name and personal address; (ii) the mobile telephone number associated with your account; and (iii) a declaration indicating clearly that you refuse the arbitration agreement in our Terms.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Competent court for small claims.</strong> In place of arbitration, if the rules of your local “small claims” court allow it, you may bring your Dispute before your local “small claims” court, provided that the case is brought individually (and not collectively).
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Deadline for bringing an action.</strong> REPLAY SARL and you recognise that in the event of a dispute (except Excluded Disputes), REPLAY SARL and you must bring any action (including initiating an arbitration procedure) within one year of the Dispute initially arising, failing which the Dispute will be time-barred.
	</p>
	<p>
		This means that if we or you do not bring an action (including initiating arbitration) within one year of the Dispute initially arising, this action will be rejected on the grounds of its late initiation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ban on participating in class actions, class arbitrations or representative actions for persons using our website, Services or Products residing in the United States or Canada. REPLAY SARL and you recognise that if you use our website in the United States or Canada, REPLAY SARL and you may bring a Dispute against the other only in your own names, and not on behalf of any other person, entity or category of persons. REPLAY SARL and you agree not to take part in a class action, class arbitration, Disputes submitted to the public prosecutor or as part of proceedings or in grouped Disputes including any other person or entity in relation to a Dispute.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Contractual separability.</strong> If the ban on class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is inapplicable to one Dispute in particular, all the above provisions entitled “Special provision on arbitration for users from the United States or Canada” will be null and void in respect of said Dispute.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Where to bring authorised legal proceedings.</strong> If you refuse the arbitration agreement, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute or if the arbitration agreement is inapplicable, you agree to submit yourself to the applicable provision of the “Settlement of Disputes” paragraph above.
	</p>
	<p>

        2 – How we use personal data
    </h3>
    <p>
        We use the data that we collect for three main purposes, described in further detail below: (1) to operate our site www.my-angel-reading.com and ensure the supply of our services or products (and to improve and customise them), (2) to send messages or offers, including promotional or free offers, and (3) to display advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
        All personal data and other information that you provide are used solely for the purpose of providing the services, products or customer services you have requested on www.my-angel-reading.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your email address is used to send electronic services that you have ordered. We also use your email address to send offers for Products and/or Services that are likely to be of interest to you. You will receive a free newsletter each month with your horoscope and articles in the fields of esotericism, clairvoyance or personal development.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in every email that we send you, or you can contact us via the section "Contact me" that is accessible directly via the site. We will remove your contact information from the lists used for sending those emails.
    </p>
    <p>
        By meeting these objectives, we combine the data that we collect through the various services or products you use on www.my-angel-reading.com so as to offer you a more homogeneous, consistent and customised experience. However, to optimise confidentiality, we have built in technological and procedural protection mechanisms, designed to prevent certain combinations of data. For example, we store the data that we collect when you are not authenticated (not logged in) separately from all account information that identifies you directly, such as your name, your first name, your email address or your telephone number.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Supply and improve our services or products –
        </strong>
        We use the data to supply and improve the services or products that we offer and to carry out the necessary sales operations. This includes operating the services, maintaining and improving performance of these services, notably developing new functions, research, and improving customer service. In this connection, we use a secret algorithm based on your first name, last name and date of birth to generate your free offer and personalised psychic reading matter that you can order.
    </p>

    <p>
        We use the data to provide our services or products. These Customer Services often include functions and personalised recommendations that optimise your productivity and your satisfaction and adapt your experience of the services or products according to your activities, your centres of interest and your location.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Correspondence –
        </strong>
        We use the data that we collect to produce and personalise our correspondence with you. For example, we may send you email or contact you by any other means to inform you about a subscription that will expire or about security updates that are available, to remind you of the customer services you have added to your online cart, to invite you to participate in a study, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Advertisement –
        </strong>
        The data we collect helps us in selecting the offers displayed by the website. These may be our own services or products or those offered by others. The offers we select may be based on your current location, your questions or the content you browse. Other targeted offers are based on the centres of interest that are likely to suit you or other information about you that we collect over time using your demographics, your searches, your centres of interest and your favourites, your usage data and your location data. This is what we refer to as "advertisements based on your centres of interest" in this statement. <strong>You can refuse to receive advertisements based on your centres of interest from the www.my-angel-reading.com website.

        <strong>

        </strong>
        Other than our Partners/Suppliers, we do not authorise any third-party advertising banners on www.my-angel-reading.com. We have no intention of using such banners, but if we ever change our position we will update this policy.
        <strong>
            Information shared between you and us -

    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>
        3 – Reason why we share or disclose your personal data
    </h3>
    <p>
        We share your personal data with your consent or as required to complete or supply any service or product that you order. For example, we share your content with third parties when you tell us to do so, by accepting our General Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Note: The payment details that you enter to complete an order can be accessed only by our partner payment platforms. Therefore, there is no sharing of this financial data between ourselves and the payment platforms.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            However, for billing and validating the orders you place, our partner payment platforms will share your payment details with the banks and other institutions that process the payment transactions or that provide other financial services, as well as for fraud prevention and the lowering of credit risk.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we share your personal data with suppliers or providers and agents operating in our name for the purposes set out in this statement. For example, our suppliers or the companies we have hired to assist us in our service to customers or to help us in the protection and security of our systems and services may need to access personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies or persons must comply with our data privacy and security requirements, and are not authorised to use the personal data that we convey to them for other purposes. We may also disclose personal data in connection with a corporate operation such as a merger or a sale of capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Note: REPLAY SARL ascertains, to the extent permitted by the governing laws and regulations, that its Suppliers and Partners that have access to your personal and financial data undertake to make their best effort to ensure the protection and privacy of your data in keeping with the principles set out in this document.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, we access, disclose and safeguard personal data, notably your content (as well as the content of your emails on our site), when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to do so:
    <ol>
        <li>
            when it is required by the governing law, or to respond to legal inquiries, notably those we receive from law-enforcement organisations and from other government organisations;
        </li>
        <li>
            to protect our customers, to avoid spamming or attempts to con the users of our services and products, or to prevent loss of life or serious injuries;
        </li>
        <li>
            to use our services and ensure their security, notably by forestalling or stopping an attack on our computer systems or networks; or
        </li>
        <li>
            to protect REPLAY SARL's ownership rights, including the application of the terms and conditions of use of the services and products. However, should we receive information indicating that a person is using our services or products for trafficking stolen physical goods or intellectual property owned by REPLAY SARL, we will not inspect the private content of a Customer or User or Visitor ourselves but will bring the matter before legal authorities.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        It must be noted that some of our services or products contain links to third party or supplier sites whose privacy rules are different from those applied by REPLAY SARL. If you provide your personal data to one of these sites, your data will be handled according to their own privacy statements.
    </p>

Regardless of the legal basis used, you always have the right to request access to, correction or deletion of your data, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
        For all persons with the capacity to enter into contractual relations, the data processing that we carry out is necessary for the performance of the contract to which you are a party (the General Terms of Use, “General Terms”). We describe the services provided under the contract for which it is necessary to process data in our General Terms and in the additional information resources accessible from the website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            In relation to the provision of our Services or Products or Customer Services under the contract, the main uses of data are:

    </p>
    <p>
        For persons who have not reached the age of majority (under 18 in most European countries) and who are not fully empowered to enter into a binding contract, it is possible that we will not be able to process personal data on the basis of contractual necessity. However, when such a person uses our website, our Services and/or Products and/or Customer Services, the following are in our legitimate interests:

    <ul>
        <li>
            supplying, improving, personalising or taking responsibility for our various offers;

            ensuring security;
        </li>
        <li>
            communicating with you, for example about issues linked to the website.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>
            The legitimate interests on which we base this processing are the following:
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Securing our platform and network, verifying accounts and their activity, combatting harmful behaviour, detecting and avoiding undesirable content and other unfavourable experiences, ensuring that our website, Services and/or Products and/or Customer Services and those of our Partners or Suppliers or Service Providers are free of harmful or inappropriate content, investigating suspicious activities or breaches of our terms or rules and ensuring the protection of persons who have not reached the age of majority, in particular by avoiding exploitation and other dangers to which these persons are particularly exposed.
